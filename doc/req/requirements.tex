\section{Project Requirements}

This section contains the requirements created for this project, with requirement numbers for structure and clarity when referencing, as well as details for each requirement.\\

The project requirements are organized based on their specificity. At the root of the project, 5 top-level project requirements exist, each encompassing a logical component of the project.
Each of the top-level requirements is then split into parts which are more specific. Some of the parts are also split into subparts. 
The subparts, or the parts if no subparts are present, then serve as more specific requirements, guiding the creation and implementation of the software.\\

The five present top-level requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REQ1.} Search Engine
    \item \textbf{REQ2.} Backend Page Processing
    \item \textbf{REQ3.} Backend Query Processing
    \item \textbf{REQ4.} Frontend Search
    \item \textbf{REQ5.} Frontend Adding Pages
\end{itemize}

For clarity and organization, the first section of this chapter consists of a series of diagrams, intended to clarify how the top-level requirements interact with one another,
as well as how they are organized internally.

\subsection{Diagrams}

The interconnection of the top-level requirements is highlighted in the following diagram:
