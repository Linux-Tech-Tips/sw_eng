Preface:
My head is currently filled with question marks concerning how google cloud/firebase actually work so take everything with a grain of salt <333

Option 1: Hugging Face ModernBERT
- pre-trained model from hugging face, open-source and we know what it's trained on
- train it for text classification (i.e. it judges how much a text suits each entry in a list of labels)
- upload it onto the hugging face website (would allow everyone on the web to access it)
- deploy it in our google cloud project
- maybe not allowed????????? idk man

Option 2: Google cloud text classification models
- fine-tune a generative model available on google cloud (e.g. gemini) similarly as described above
- definitely allowed
- not open source afaik, idk what it's been trained on

Option 3: Google cloud embedding model
- e.g. E5 (open-source)
- afaik (?????? so much salt) takes in text and spits out vectors
- can be fine-tuned in google cloud to work better with the linux manual

Option 4: Firebase upload custom tensorflow model
- uhhh I barely understand this actually
- I think that firebase lets you upload a tensorflow model?
- Would probably function similarly to option 1
