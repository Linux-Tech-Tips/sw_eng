In addition to the aforementioned issues with Google Cloud and Firebase faced by the entire backend team, Martin's biggest issue faced during the development of the process was regarding page fragmentation. 

At first, the error log specifying that the word meaning page matrices were simply too big/had too many indices for the database suggested that an entire third of our project wouldn't be usable at all. Converting the page matrices to strings seemed like a good solution, until there proved to be pages greater than even the string size limit. Having to come up with both the idea and implementation for page fragmentation into multiple Firestore documents was certainly a notable unexpected challenge.
