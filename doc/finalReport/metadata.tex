\subsection{Metadata search}

The metadata score is calculated simply based on the stored frequency data.
For each page, the stored frequency data is fetched from the database.
Then, for each word in the query, if a non-zero frequency value exists in the page, it is added to a cumulative counter.
The counter is then divided by the length of the query, normalising it to a percentage value between 0 and 1.
