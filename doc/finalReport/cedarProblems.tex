\subsection{Elisabeth Pfeiffer}
The largest problem Elisabeth encountered was trying to decide how to implement the word embeddings. One of the original ideas was to have a word embeddings model running inference on the website's server for optimal accuracy. After some work into this avenue it was looking promising,  but further investigation of google cloud pricing made it clear that this would not be possible. \\
As such, they decided to change track and simply upload a large file of words with their respective vectors into the database which would function as a lookup table. This was also not without issue, as trying to trim the original file of 300 000 word vectors down to an affordable but still useful number proved difficult.
They eventually decided to do this by reading in 33 files of technical documentation and only uploading the words found in these pages. This resulted in a final number of 5249 words. \\

An issue faced while working on the addPage functionality was encountering firebase reserved terms. There are terms not permitted to use as indexes for anything in firebase, but it is nigh impossible to find a list of these terms to exclude them. Elisabeth found a list posted online after some searching and decided to implement this in the textProcessing portion, so that these terms would simply be removed from any text so as to not cause any issues.
