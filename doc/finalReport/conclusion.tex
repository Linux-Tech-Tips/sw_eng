\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this was a very fulfilling and interesting project. We learned a lot in the process about search engines and text processing, but also about software engineering, teamwork, project management and both backend and frontend programming. It would have been good to have more time to implement more features and optimizations, but all in all we are very proud of our work.
