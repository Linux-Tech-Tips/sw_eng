\section{Introduction}
The Technical Documentation Search Engine (\textit{TDS Engine}) is a search engine optimised for technical documentation developed by the Unix User Group for the University module CT216 Software Engineering. \\
The decision to make this the project was made due to seeing a gap in the field of search engines for technical documentation. The quality of regular search engines can be quite poor when trying to find relevant technical information, due to the results being filled with spam and copy pasted commercial content. This can make it very difficult to find anything helpful. Furthermore, we wished to create something novel and challenging, and this project filled that niche. \\

This report details the functionality of the engine, how to use it, and how the work was divided.
