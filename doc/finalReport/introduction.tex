\section{Introduction}
The Technical Documentation Search Engine (\textit{TDS Engine}) is a search engine optimised for technical documentation developed by the Unix User Group for the University module CT216 Software Engineering. \\
The decision to make this the project was made due seeing a gap in the field of search engines for technical documentation, which can make it very difficult to find helpful information. Furthermore, we wished to create something novel and challenging, and this project filled that niche. \\

This report details the functionality of the engine, how to use it, and how the work was divided.
