\section{Project Description}

The key differentiating features between the TDS Engine and most commonly used search engines are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item being optimised to process dense text and technical documentation, which makes it easier for the user to find relevant pages;
  \item adding only explicitly trusted and relevant pages, thus excluding spam and minimising irrelevant results.
\end{itemize}

In order to process the raw page data into a form that can be used by the search functions, the following data processing occurs before it is stored in the database:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item html tags, script blocks, and the header section are removed from the page, saving the title for further processing;
  \item all text is set to lower case, stop words and special characters are removed, which results in a plaintext string where words are separated by one space;
  \item for the metadata functionality, the frequency of each word/term in the processed plaintext is counted and stored in the database;
  \item for the meaings search, each word in the page is replaced by its respective word embedding. These are vectors which represent the semantic meaning of words. 
\end{enumerate}

The search functionality itself is split up into three subsections:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a \textbf{meanings search} based on vectors representing a word's semantic meaning;
  \item a \textbf{metadata search} based on the page's metadata, notably considering term frequency;
  \item a \textbf{literal text search} based on word's spellings (this functions as a fuzzy search).
\end{enumerate}
These are then combined together to create a final similarity result between a page and a query, which is passed onto the front end. \\

The front end has the following functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item users can search for pages and get redirected to a results page, which shows a ranked list of pages similar to their query;
  \item users can add pages to the engine's database.
\end{enumerate}

Being split into well-defined components, the functionality is very modular, which simplified collaboration and enabled us to split up project work and develop the sections simultaneously.
