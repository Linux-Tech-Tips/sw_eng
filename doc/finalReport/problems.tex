\section{Problems Encountered}
A project as large as this doesn't come without problems. What follows is a compilation of each member's specific problems and how they fixed them. \\

One issue the entire backend team faced repeatedly was firebase. We found that firebase/google cloud documentation was very difficult to find, and then sometimes inaccurate or not very helpful.
Especially the firestore database had many rules (e.g. maximum document size, cannot hold multi-dimensional arrays, document names must be strings) that we didn't realise until we encountered errors while working. 
As such we regularly had to restructure our approaches to suit the newly discovered restrictions. 
Furthermore, google cloud error logs were often difficult to understand, as they were often not descriptive or didn't mention where in the program the error appeared. In one instance, google cloud did not print a console.log statement which held important debugging information, which made the process much harder.\\
Technical issues aside, many of the team members had health issues while working on this project, which interferred with our ability to do our best work.
