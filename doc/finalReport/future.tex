\section{Future of the TDS Engine}
It would be incredibly fun to continue polishing the engine. Features we had intended to implement but didn't have time for include user accounts and giving the user the ability to adjust how much weight is placed onto each search type. Displaying the different similarity scores for each results page would also be interesting. \\
Having the time to do more speed and accuracy optimisation would also be excellent, as that would make the engine more usable.
