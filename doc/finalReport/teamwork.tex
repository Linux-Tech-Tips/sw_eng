\section{Teamwork and Communication}
The regular stand ups were invaluable for team communication. We also had a discord group chat where we posted any other updates and pinned helpful messages and links. As a part of our standups we always checked in on everyone to ask if they needed help or to change tasks. This fostered an environment where everyone felt comfortable asking for help and sending frequent updates, which made the project go smoothly and be less stressful. \\
The github kanban board was also an important part of the communication. It helped keep track of task progress even when not directly speaking to each other.
