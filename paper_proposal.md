# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT RESEARCH SUMMARY

This document is a brief summary of the core research concepts of the Software Engineering project of our group.

The project itself is meant to be a search engine optimized more specifically for technical documentation, with functionality to add trusted pages rather than searching the entire internet.

This approach provides two notable benefits over searching for technical details on regular online engines:

1. Being able to select explicitly trusted pages (top-level domains and possibly included subdomains) will introduce moderation and will exclude the typical sites advertising their product with content copy-pasted from forums
2. Optimizing the search engine to find technical information in dense text should optimally make it so relevant parts of technical docs can be looked up easily

As part of the challenge and for the purposes of optimization, a major backend component of this project is building a custom search engine from scratch.
