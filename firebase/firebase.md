# Firebase instructions

This repository contains the firebase functions and other content necessary for the project.

For now, the folder is set to track UniDemoProject under Martin's account, this will later be changed to the actual Firebase project for the app.

## How to use

Given a clean copy of this branch, the firebase `demo_project` folder can be used as follows:

1. Make sure `firebase` is installed and you're logged in under an account with access to the project (instructions in lecture slides)
2. Navigate to `demo_project/functions` and call `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
3. Navigate to `demo_project`, make any desired changes and call `firebase deploy` to push the changes to the online project
